## About

The effect of ecological network structure on the dynamics, stability, and, ultimately, diversity
of ecological communities has been the center of an ongoing debate in the past 45 years.
Several authors hypothesized that the observed departures from random structure observed in
ecological networks are therefore &quot;adaptive&quot;. Indeed, a common hypothesis is that biological
network structure is influenced by evolution, coevolution and/or adaptation: structures
yielding unfavorable dynamics would be eliminated from the space of possible networks, so
that in nature we would tend to observe structures that have withstood the test of time. An
alternative view is the &quot;network spandrel&quot; hypothesis - a nod to the famous critique of the
adaptionist programme by Gould and Lewontin: deviations from randomness in biological
networks are the by-product of the network assembly process, and are therefore non-adaptive.
While the implications of network structure for community/population dynamics are well
studied, we know very little regarding the effect of dynamics on the structure of networks.
The goal of this satellite is to explore how these two alternative processes contribute to the
structure of biological networks and to explore whether, and how, they can be disentangled.
This debate is crucial for our understanding of network assembly in particular and for
understanding processes of network optimization in nature in general. The satellite we are
proposing will not only spark a new debate in biology, but is also highly relevant for other
disciplines because understanding the relationship between structure and dynamics is a
cornerstone of every complex adaptive system.

<!--Github's Octocat was designed by Simon Oxley, alongside the white bird Twitter used (before they received a proper logo) as part of a usual routine of cranking out images for iStock. GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much like the octopuss... except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has been the octocat since <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>.-->
