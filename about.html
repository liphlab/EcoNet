## About

Living systems are characterized by the recurrent emergence of patterns: power-laws
distributions, long-range correlations and structured self-organization in living matter are
the norm, rather than the exception. All these features are also typical of thermo-dynamical
systems poised near a critical point. The great lesson from physics is that criticality can
emerge as a collective behaviour in a many-body system with simple (e.g. pairwise)
interactions and its characteristics depend only on few details like the dimensionality or
symmetries.

In a statistical-mechanics approach, it is fundamental to determine the order parameter,
which characterizes the different system phases. This is a crucial step to obtain the key
ingredients needed to formulate a modeling framework, so as to obtain a better
understanding of the system&#39;s macroscopic behaviour. However, the understating of
biological/social systems needs more than a mere generalization of the standard statistical
mechanics approach.

One of the most striking feature of living systems is that they are structured as evolving
systems were interactions can turn-on or off, as well as strengthening and weakening,
reconfiguring the system connectivity. Thus, by rearranging both the structural and
functional topology, living interacting systems may demonstrate unique evolvability,
scalability and adaptability properties.
It is of crucial importance to make further steps in the understanding of the main properties
that simultaneously confer to these systems high level of both adaptability and robustness.
If we can “learn” from evolution, then we would be able to both better manage/supervise
these systems and also design more optimal and sustainable new systems.

<!--Github's Octocat was designed by Simon Oxley, alongside the white bird Twitter used (before they received a proper logo) as part of a usual routine of cranking out images for iStock. GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much like the octopuss... except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has been the octocat since <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>.-->
